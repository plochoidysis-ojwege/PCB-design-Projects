# PCB Design Projects

I created this repository to document my learning journey with KiCad and to share my designs with others. My goal is to create a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to get started with PCB design using KiCad and also as a personal reference for my future projects.
The structure of this repository is as follows:
1. Learning and Desmistifying KiCad first directory- here , I use tutorials and examples to learn the basics of KiCad and PCB design.
2. My original designs directory - here, I apply what I've learned in more advanced projects and explore additional features of KiCad.
3. Documentation-of essence, each project has its own documentation folder in its directory, so this directory has two files :
   - Glossary of KiCad terms.md - here, I define key terms and concepts related to KiCad and PCB design.
   - Important links.md - here, I keep links to all the documentation related to my projects, including design notes, tutorials, and references, but of essence, each project has its own documentation folder in its directory.
   * Note that:
- Each project is contained within its own directory
- Each project directory includes the KiCad project files, as well as any relevant documentation
- The README.md file in each project directory provides an overview of the project and its goals.
