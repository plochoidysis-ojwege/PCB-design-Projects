In this directory are designs that I used to learn KiCad, the workflow and the design principles. The designs are simple and not meant to be manufactured. The goal is to learn the tool and the design process. Some of the key concepts I focused on include:

- Schematic capture
- PCB layout
- Design rules
- Gerber file generation

I hope these designs serve as a useful reference for anyone looking to get started with KiCad and as a reference for me as I continue to learn and improve my skills.
